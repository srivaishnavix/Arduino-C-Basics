//we have multiple builtin libraries to interact with various electronics
//we can download these libraries from the internet
//there's a specific library for LCD screen
//There are a few builtin libraries that are already present in the arduino IDE
//LEt's use the LCD library
//It is named LiquidCrystal.h

#include<LiquidCrystal.h>
#include<SD.h>//this is for reading and writing into SD cards
//now we can access the function in these libraries
//The function we were using like the Serial.begin.println, DigitalWriteread, etc are all in some libraries
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  

}

//You can install extra libraries using library manager under sketch
//or download libraries as zip folder, usually from github, reliable and latest version available
